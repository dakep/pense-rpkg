2016-06-29: Version 0.5.3
    *) Guard against invalid numeric values of relative change when checking for convergence
    *) Fix R check NOTES by removing unnecessary namespace prefixes in parallel executed functions

2016-06-24: Version 0.5.2
    *) Bug fix release. Fix bad memory access bug when EN is called with no observations present
    *) Adjust quantile function such that it always returns the smallest value that is greater
       than at least "quantile" values (except when all values are identical).

2016-06-12: Version 0.5.0
    *) Rename package to "pense"
    *) Remove dependencies on mmlasso
    *) Fix all warnings/notes from R checks

2016-05-19: Version 0.3.6
    *) Added functionality for weighted elastic net.
    *) Utilize weighted elastic net in PENSE iterations as well as M-step iterations
    *) Port pensemstep to C++

2016-05-08: Version 0.3.4
    *) Switch from coordinate gradient descent to augmented LARS by default for computing
       the elastic net solution. The old algorithm is still available and can be chosen
       with the `en.algorithm` parameter.
    *) New funciton "mstep": add M-step to PENSE
    *) Port pen.s.reg to C++

2016-04-06: Version 0.3.2
    *) lambda.min.ratio can be set in the call to pense
    *) lambda.min.ratio for automatically computed grid of lambda values is now
       chosen based on the ratio of the number of variables to observations by the formula
       1e-3 * 10^floor(log10(p / n))
    Non-visible changes:
    *) Use warm-starts for elastic net during PENSE iterations

2016-03-31: Version 0.3.1
    Non-visible changes:
    *) Remove legacy code to adjust lambda and solve the mscale with cc=1
    *) Factor generating the lambda grid out to a private function
