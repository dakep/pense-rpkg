2016-04-13: Version 0.3.3.1
    *) New funciton "pensem": add M-step for L1 penalty to PENSE

2016-04-06: Version 0.3.2
    *) lambda.min.ratio can be set in the call to pense
    *) lambda.min.ratio for automatically computed grid of lambda values is now
       chosen based on the ratio of the number of variables to observations by the formula
       1e-3 * 10^floor(log10(p / n))
    Non-visible changes:
    *) Use warm-starts for elastic net during PENSE iterations

2016-03-31: Version 0.3.1
    Non-visible changes:
    *) Remove legacy code to adjust lambda and solve the mscale with cc=1
    *) Factor generating the lambda grid out to a private function
