2016-XX-XX: Version 0.X.X
    *) lambda.min.ratio for automatically computed grid of lambda values is now
       chosen based on the ratio of the number of variables to observations by the formula
       1e-3 * 10^floor(log10(p / n))
    Non-visible changes:
    *) Use warm-starts for elastic net during PENSE iterations

2016-03-31: Version 0.3.1
    Non-visible changes:
    *) Remove legacy code to adjust lambda and solve the mscale with cc=1
    *) Factor generating the lambda grid out to a private function
