\item{max_it}{maximum number of EN-PY iterations.}

\item{en_algorithm_opts}{options for the LS-EN algorithm. See \link{en_algorithm_options} for details.}

\item{keep_residuals_measure}{how to determine what observations to keep, based on their residuals.
If \code{proportion}, a fixed number of observations is kept.
If \code{threshold}, only observations with residuals below the threshold are kept.}

\item{keep_residuals_proportion}{proportion of observations to kept based on their residuals.}

\item{keep_residuals_threshold}{only observations with (standardized) residuals less than this threshold are kept.}

\item{retain_best_factor}{only keep candidates that are within this factor of the best candidate. If \verb{<= 1}, only
keep candidates from the last iteration.}

\item{retain_max}{maximum number of candidates, i.e., only the best \code{retain_max} candidates are retained.}

\description{
Additional control options for the elastic net PeÃ±a-Yohai procedure.

\details{
The EN-PY procedure for computing initial estimates iteratively cleans the data of observations with possibly
outlying residual or high leverage. Least-squares elastic net (LS-EN) estimates are computed on the possibly clean
subsets. At each iteration, the Principal Sensitivity Components are computed to remove observations with potentially
high leverage. Among all the LS-EN estimates, the estimate with smallest M-scale of the residuals is selected.
Observations with largest residual for the selected estimate are removed and the next iteration is started.
