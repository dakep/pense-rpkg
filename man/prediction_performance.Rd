\title{Prediction Performance of Adaptive PENSE Fits}
\usage{
prediction_performance(..., lambda = c("min", "se"), se_mult = 1)

\method{print}{pense_pred_perf}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{one or more (adaptive) PENSE fits with cross-validation information.}

\item{lambda}{a string specifying which penalty level to use (\code{"min"} or \code{"se"}) . See details.}

\item{se_mult}{If \code{lambda = "se"}, the multiple of standard errors to tolerate.}
}
\value{
a data frame with details about the prediction performance of the given PENSE fits. The data frame
has a custom print method summarizing the prediction performances.
}
\description{
Extract the prediction performance of one or more (adaptive) PENSE fits.
}
\details{
If \code{lambda = "se"} and the cross-validation was performed with multiple replications, use the penalty level whit
prediction performance within \code{se_mult} of the best prediction performance.

\seealso{
\code{\link[=summarize.pense_cvfit]{summarize.pense_cvfit()}} for a summary of the fitted model.
